# LibThreatClassic2

Successor project for [https://github.com/EsreverWoW/LibThreatClassic](https://github.com/EsreverWoW/LibThreatClassic)

## How to use

Get the latest revision from LibStub and then register your addon as using LibThreatClassic:

```
local ThreadLib = LibStub("LibThreatClassic2", true)
if ThreadLib then
    ThreadLib:RegisterAddon("YourAddon")
end
```

`:UnreagisterAddon` can be used to send LibThreatClassic into idle, if no other addon is registered.
